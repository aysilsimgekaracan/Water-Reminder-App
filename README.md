This is a simple Water Reminder App that I built for learning Async Storage, Animations (Animated API) and Local Notifications.

1. Async Storage -> The app stores your goal amount of water and the amount water you drank

2. Animations -> The app has some animations to make it look nicer and smooth.

3. Local Notifications -> The app has scheduled notifications to remind you to drink water
